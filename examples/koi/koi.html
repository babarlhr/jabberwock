            <h2>A very short summary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koi">Koi article from Wikipedia</a></h2>
            <p>Koi (鯉, English: /ˈkɔɪ/, Japanese: [koꜜi]) or more specifically jinli or nishikigoi (錦鯉, [ɲiɕi̥kiꜜɡoi], literally
                "brocaded carp"), are colored varieties of the Amur carp (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) that are kept for decorative purposes in
                outdoor koi ponds or water gardens.

            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            <p>The words "koi" and "nishikigoi" come from the Japanese reading of Classical Chinese words 鯉 (common carp) and 錦鯉
                (brocaded carp) respectively. In both languages, the former can refer to many Asian carp species, including (and most
                commonly referring to) some invasive species in the United States. In Japanese, "koi" is a homophone for another word
                that means "affection" or "love", so koi are symbols of love and friendship in Japan. The first mention of the word "錦鯉"
                dates back to Tang Dynasty China:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>錦鯉沖風擲，絲禽掠浪飛。短亭幽徑入，陳廟數峰圍。</p>
                <p><strong>The "koi" plunged into the wind and the birds flew in the waves</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>About koi varietes and color</h3>
            <p>Koi is an informal group name of the colored variants of C. rubrofuscus. Several varieties are recognized by the
                Japanese. Koi varieties are distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are
                white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, and cream. The most popular category of koi is the Gosanke, which is made
                up of the following varieties:

            <h3>Health, maintenance, and longevity</h3>
            <p>The Amur carp is a hardy fish, and koi retain that durability. Koi are coldwater fish, but benefit from being kept in
                the 15–25 °C (59–77 °F) range, and do not react well to long, cold, winter temperatures; their immune systems are very
                weak below 10 °C. Koi ponds usually have a metre or more of depth in areas of the world that become warm during the
                summer, whereas in areas that have harsher winters, ponds generally have a minimum of 1.5 m (5 ft). Specific pond
                construction has been evolved by koi keepers intent on raising show-quality koi.</p>
