<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Jabberwocky</h1>
<h3>by Lewis Carroll</h3>
<p><i><span class="drop-cap">’T</span>was brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/>
<br/>
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br/>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br/>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br/>
The frumious Bandersnatch!”<br/>
<br/>
He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br/>
Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br/>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br/>
And stood awhile in thought.<br/>
<br/>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br/>
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br/>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br/>
And burbled as it came!<br/>
<br/>
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br/>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br/>
He left it dead, and with its head<br/>
He went galumphing back.<br/>
<br/>
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br/>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br/>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br/>
He chortled in his joy.<br/>
<br/>
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/></i></p>

"Jabberwocky" has been translated into numerous languages,<sup>[31]</sup> as the novel has been <b>translated</b> into 65 languages.[32] The translation might be difficult because <i>the poem holds to English syntax and many of the principal words of the poem are invented. Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the morphology of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, "'Twas brillig" becomes "Il brilgue". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's lexicon, but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. Douglas Hofstadter noted in his essay "Translations of Jabberwocky", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to lubricate) to give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks "what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps<b> 'huilasse' would be better than</b> 'lubricilleux'? </i> Or does the Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)?
