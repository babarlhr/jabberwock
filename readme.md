## Story
During the dark age of the web came version 5.5 of Internet Explorer.\
In its wake, the contentEditable attribute was born.\
Its purpose was to bestow the user with the power of creation.\
All the major browsers of the time wanted their share of the god-like power,\
and so they sought to implement the new attribute in their own reality.\
Unfortunately, they failed to coordinate their efforts and, in so doing,\
created multiple different and incompatible implementations of contentEditable.

Since the behavior of the new attribute was unreliable accross the different\
browsers, it was impossible for anyone to access the power it promised.\
They wanted to empower their users, but they instead created a hideous creature.\
The original Jabberwock monster of the web was born.\
Many brave souls tried to tame the beast and failed, while others foolishly\
sought out to craft new vessels in order to contain the power of creation.

Then came the first iPhone and, with it, the web entered the mobile age.\
This new era forever changed the relationship between human and machine.\
Old technologies died while new ones arose. The people who sought to contain the\
power of creation in a vessel of their own making failed to evolve fast enough\
and were unable to withstand the pressure as their followers abandonned them.\
Following the cataclysm, among the rubbles of technologies from ages past,\
something stirred. The Jabberwock still lived, undefeated.

At this time, it became clear that the Jabberwock itself was the only creature\
able to properly contain the power of creation while surviving in the web.\
Seeking to reclaim the beast's powers to return it to their human brethren, a\
small team of developers assembled in an abandonned farm in the land of Belgium.\
The Jabberwock could not be killed, so they devised another way to harness its power.\
They worked tirelessly and, thanks to their vorpal skills, were able to design\
an artifact able to channel the god-like powers from the monster itself directly\
into the hands of its wielders.

This git repository tells the story of these brave developers. It is the journal\
of the creation of their marvelous artifact, a node package that channels the\
power of the Jabberwock itself, the raw power of creation, for all humans alike.
